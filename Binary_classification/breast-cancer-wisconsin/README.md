Q2
+ Repeat training of the model 5 times

Q3
+ Investigate whether the activation function of the hidden layer affects the accuracy. 
+ still the same model (the # of hidden neurons: 10) 
  4 different cases: None, Relu, sigmoid, tanh
  For each case, repeat training 10 times and report the 
  mean and standard deviation of loss and accuracy in the 
  training and test data set.
  
Q4
  + Change # of hidden neurons systematically, and then re-training the model. 
    Collect the data and construct the table for the following # of 
    hidden neurons: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000.
  + For each case, repeat training 5 times and report the mean 
    and standard deviation of loss and accuracy in the training 
    and test data set. 
    
QE2
  + After learning, we can analyze the learned weights. 
  + Construct a model without a hidden layer; all input 
    units are directly corrected to the output.
